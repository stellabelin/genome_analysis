# Genome Analysis
The aim of this project is to recreate the workflow of Eckalbar _et al._ (2016). The overall aim of that paper was characterize transcriptomic and epigenomic factors to the development of bat wings. Since bats are the only mammals with the ability to fly, studying epigenetic factors could be interesting to be able to find out the factors for that. See [wiki](https://github.com/stellabelin/genome_analysis/wiki) for further information.
